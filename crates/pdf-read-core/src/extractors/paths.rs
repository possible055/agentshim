//! Path extraction from PDF content streams.
//!
//! This module provides the `PathExtractor` type for extracting vector graphics
//! (paths) from PDF content streams.
//!
//! # PDF Path Operations
//!
//! PDF paths are constructed using a sequence of operators:
//! - `m` (MoveTo): Begin a new subpath
//! - `l` (LineTo): Add a line segment
//! - `c`, `v`, `y` (CurveTo variants): Add Bezier curve segments
//! - `re` (Rectangle): Add a rectangle as a complete subpath
//! - `h` (ClosePath): Close the current subpath
//!
//! Paths are then painted using:
//! - `S` (Stroke): Stroke the path
//! - `f`, `F`, `f*` (Fill): Fill the path
//! - `B`, `B*`, `b`, `b*`: Fill and stroke
//! - `n` (EndPath): End path without painting (used with clipping)
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```ignore
//! use pdf_oxide::extractors::paths::PathExtractor;
//!
//! let mut extractor = PathExtractor::new();
//!
//! // Process path construction operators
//! extractor.move_to(100.0, 100.0);
//! extractor.line_to(200.0, 100.0);
//! extractor.line_to(200.0, 200.0);
//! extractor.close_path();
//!
//! // Finalize with a painting operator
//! extractor.stroke();
//!
//! // Get extracted paths
//! let paths = extractor.finish();
//! ```
